In this project, I have done a Thematic Analysis of video-based Advertisements. The method used is :- 

1. Collecting Ads
2. Trascribing each Ad
3. Generating Initial codes.
4. Gathering codes to find Themes.
5. Finding answers to predefined Research Questions.


The Research Questions (RQs) defined for the above work are :- 

```RQ1 : Communication Strategy - How is sustainability communicated in ads through language, visuals & storytelling ?```
```RQ2 : Authenticity vs Marketing - Do the ads use real practice-backed claims or are they just marketing tools ? ```
```RQ3 : Greenwashing Risk Assesment - How prevalent are vague, misleading or exaggerated claims? ```
